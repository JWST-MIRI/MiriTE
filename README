The teams/miri directory contains software developed by the MIRI 
European Consortium software team. The software contained here is 
designed to support the creation and management of the MIRI
calibration data products, support the development of MIRI
pipeline algorithms and support the development of STScI JWST
pipeline software (while not being part of that pipeline software).

The software depends on the JWST infrastructure libraries and STScI
ASDF package.

CONTENTS
--------

MiriTools
~~~~~~~~~
Tools and utilities which are used by many MIRI applications.

miri.tools - A collection of general purpose tools and utilities

miri.datamodels
           - MIRI data models, including two collections
   .cdp    - Data models supporting MIRI Calibration Data Products
   .sim    - Data models supporting MIRI simulators

MiriSimulators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A collection of MIRI data simulators.

miri.simulators
             - A collection of miri simulators, including
   .mirimsim - The MIRI imager simulator (MirImSim)
   .scasim   - The MIRI Sensor Chip Assembly simulator (SCASim)


The top-level folder contains the following top level tools, utilities
and documents:

README       - Read this file first.
LICENCE      - Terms and conditions of use.
setup.py     - Python setup file used to build the MIRI packages
setup.cfg    - Configuration file for commonly used utilities.
miri_installation_check.py
             - Script which checks all packages are installed correctly.


Each of the package directories also contain the following files:

__init__.py    - Initialisation script for a Python source code
                 directory. Also contains a package description.
svn_version.py - Used by SVN to indicate the latest version numbers.

The top level doc and lib directories contain documentation and 
utilities connected with the installation of the MIRI software itself.

Version control information within each package is shared between the
_init__.py file and the documentation configuration file,
doc/source/conf.py


STANDARD DIRECTORY NAMES
------------------------
Software is stored within this repository in a standard directory tree 
consisting of these directories:

data     - Data used by the package
doc      - Documentation for the package
doc/source  - Source directory containing release notes etc...
doc/source/reference  - Contains additional documents referenced from source
scripts  - Scripts and application programs for the package
tests    - Unit tests for the package


INSTALLATION
------------
The MIRI software may be built and installed with the command

   python setup.py install

This is normally done as part of the MIRICLE installation script.


TESTING
-------
The unit tests included with the MIRI software can be run from the
teams/miri directory using nosetests or pytests by running either of
the scripts

   run_nosetests.sh
   run_pytests.sh
