The simulators directory contains a collection of MIRI instrument 
simulators. Only one simulator subpackage is contained here:

The scasim subpackage contains the MIRI Sensor Chip Array Simulator 
software (SCASim), developed by the UKATC, Edinburgh, UK.

Other MIRI simulator packages have been released separately in a
software simulator called MIRISim.
See http://miri.ster.kuleuven.be/bin/view/Public/MIRISim_Public

Documentation describing this software may be found within the "doc" 
directory. The following commands will build a new set of documentation
(assuming you have a compatible version of latex installed on your workstation):

cd doc
make html
make latex         # Requires latex
make latexpdf      # Requires latex and latexmk

If you don't have latexmk installed, the following commands can be used to
build the PDF document manually:

pushd build/latex
latex miri_scasim.tex
latex miri_scasim.tex
pdflatex miri_scasim.tex
popd

After executing these commands you will find a reference manual in 
"build/latex/miri_scasim.pdf" and more readable set of HTML pages in
"build/html".
