This directory contains the MIRI data models, miri.datamodels. These are
based on the JWST data models, jwst.datamodels, which are described in the
"JDox" documentation here:

https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/display/JDAT/JWST+File+Names%2C+Formats%2C+and+Data+Structures

YAML schemas describing each data model may be found in the "schemas"
subdirectory.

Documentation describing this software may be found within the "doc" 
directory. The following commands will build a new set of documentation:

cd doc
make html
make latex
cd build/latex
make all-pdf

After executing these commands you will find a reference manual in 
"build/latex/miri_datamodels.pdf" and more readable set of HTML pages in
"build/html". The latest PDF documentation may be found at
http://miri.ster.kuleuven.be/pub/Public/MIRISim_Public/miri_datamodels.pdf
