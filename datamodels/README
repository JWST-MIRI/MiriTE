This directory contains the MIRI data models, miri.datamodels. These are
based on the JWST data models, jwst.datamodels, which are described in the
"JDox" documentation here:

https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/display/JDAT/JWST+File+Names%2C+Formats%2C+and+Data+Structures

YAML schemas describing each data model may be found in the "schemas"
subdirectory.

The basic data models may be imported from "datamodels", the MIRI calibration
data products from "datamodels.cdp" and simulator support models from
"datamodels.sim". Some common examples:

   import miri.datamodels as dm
   model1 = dm.MiriDataModel( filename1 )
   model2 = dm.MiriMeasuredModel( filename2 )
   
   from miri.datamodels.cdp import MiriFlatfieldModel, MiriBadPixelMaskModel
   model1 = MiriFlatfieldModel( filename1 )
   model2 = MiriBadPixelMaskModel( filename2 )

   from miri.datamodels.sim import MiriIlluminationModel
   model1 = MiriIlluminationModel( filename1 )

The open() function will open a file and attempt to match the contents to
a known data model:

   import miri.datamodels.open as open
   model = open( filename )

Documentation describing this software may be found within the "doc" 
directory. The following commands will build a new set of documentation
(assuming you have a compatible version of latex installed on your workstation):

cd doc
make html
make latex         # Requires latex
make latexpdf      # Requires latex and latexmk

If you don't have latexmk installed, the following commands can be used to
build the PDF document manually:

pushd build/latex
latex miri_datamodels.tex
latex miri_datamodels.tex
pdflatex miri_datamodels.tex
popd

After executing these commands you will find a reference manual in 
"build/latex/miri_datamodels.pdf" and more readable set of HTML pages in
"build/html". The latest PDF documentation may be found at
http://miri.ster.kuleuven.be/pub/Public/MIRISim_Public/miri_datamodels.pdf
