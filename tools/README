The miri.tools package contains a collection of general purpose tools 
and utilities software developed by the MIRI European Consortium 
software team.

Documentation describing this software may be found within the "doc" 
directory. The following commands will build a new set of documentation
(assuming you have a compatible version of latex installed on your workstation):

cd doc
make html
make latex         # Requires latex
make latexpdf      # Requires latex and latexmk

If you don't have latexmk installed, the following commands can be used to
build the PDF document manually:

pushd build/latex
latex miri_tools.tex
latex miri_tools.tex
pdflatex miri_tools.tex
popd

After executing these commands you will find a reference manual in 
"build/latex/miri_tools.pdf" and more readable set of HTML pages in
"build/html". The latest PDF documentation may be found at
